# ECStinyPTC
Entity Component System (videogame motor grhapics)  based linux library PTC. 
This proyect its running in Ubuntu 20, but you can use fedora and manjaro SO. Its important to get libX11 to render windows. 
Only download and execute makefile all, this makefile clean all .o and builds library . 
You can individually compile and link each library. I use tinyPNG to decode and convert PNG files in byteArrays to transform RGB and render in window. 

The objective about this proyect its build a native videogame 2D and efficiency programing techniques. 

C++ 17. You can change the c++ version change the makefile flags.

Not complete, the next stage its create ID for each component to identificate in the code.
